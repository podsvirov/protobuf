This directory contains *CMake* files that can be used to build protobuf
with *MSVC* on *Windows*. You can build the project as a from *Command Prompt*
and using an *Visual Studio* IDE.

You need to have [CMake](http://www.cmake.org), [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com)
and optionaly [Git](http://git-scm.com) installed on your computer before proceeding.

Most of the instruction will be given to the *Ð¡ommand Prompt*, but the same
actions can be performed using appropriate GUI tools.

Setting Environment
===================

From *Start* menu button open appropriate *Command Prompt*.

For example: *Start* > *Visual Studio 2013* > *Visual Studio Tools* >
*VS2013 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt*. You should see the *Command Prompt*:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin\amd64>

Change current drive letter, if needed:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin\amd64>X:
    X:\>

Where *X* is your working drive letter. And change directory to your working folder:

    X:\>cd Path\to
    X:\Path\to>

Where *Path\to* is path to your real working folder.

Make folder where builded protobuf will be installed:

    X:\Path\to>mkdir install

If *cmake* coomand is not avaliable from *Command Promt*, add it in system *PATH* variable:

    X:\Path\to>set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake\bin

If *git* coomand is not avaliable from *Command Promt*, add it in system *PATH* variable:

    X:\Path\to>set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Git\cmd

Good. Now you are ready to continue.

Getting Sources
===============

You can get the latest stable source packages from the
[releases](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases) page.
Or you can type:

     X:\Path\to> git clone -b release_tag https://github.com/google/protobuf.git

Where *release_tag* is a real repository tag or branch name as a *master*
if you want to get the latest code.

Go to the project folder:

     X:\Path\to>cd protobuf
     X:\Path\to\protobuf>

Check whether a *gmock* directory exists in the upper level directory. If you
checkout the code from GitHub via `git clone`, this *gmock* directory won't
exist and you won't be able to build protobuf unit-tests.

These source packages from *releases* page contains more stable versions of protobuf
and already have the *gmock* directory included.

If even so the *gmock* folder does not exist, you can download it as follows:

     X:\Path\to\protobuf>git clone -b release-1.7.0 https://github.com/google/googlemock.git gmock

Then go to *gmock* folder and downdload gtest:

     X:\Path\to\protobuf>cd gmock
     X:\Path\to\protobuf\gmock>git clone -b release-1.7.0 https://github.com/google/googletest.git gtest

If you absolutely don't want to build and run protobuf unit-tests, skip
this steps and use protobuf at your own risk.

Now go to *cmake* folder in protobuf sources:

     X:\Path\to\protobuf\gmock>cd ..\cmake
     X:\Path\to\protobuf\cmake>

Good. Now you are ready to *CMake* configuration.

CMake Configuration
===================

The *CMake* provides a lot of different
[generators](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html)
for various native build system.
We are interested a
[Makefile](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#makefile-generators)
and a
[Visual Studio](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#visual-studio-generators)
generators.

We will use shadow building to separate the temporary files from the protobuf source code.

Make temporary *build* folder and change directory to:

     X:\Path\to\protobuf\cmake>mkdir build & cd build
     X:\Path\to\protobuf\cmake\build>

The *Makefile* generator can build the project in only one configuration, so you need to build
a separate folder for each configuration.

To start using a *Release* configuration:

     X:\Path\to\protobuf\cmake\build>mkdir release & cd release
     X:\Path\to\protobuf\cmake\build\release>cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ^
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../../../install ^
     ../..

It will generate *nmake* *Makefile* in current directory.

To using a *Debug* configuration from *build* folder type:

     X:\Path\to\protobuf\cmake\build>mkdir debug & cd debug
     X:\Path\to\protobuf\cmake\build\debug>cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ^
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ^
     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../../../install ^
     ../..

It will generate *nmake* *Makefile* in current directory.

To make *Visual Studio* solution file from *build* folder type:

     X:\Path\to\protobuf\cmake>mkdir solution & cd solution
     X:\Path\to\protobuf\cmake\solution>cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" ^
     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../../../install ^
     ../..

It will generate *Visual Studion* solution file *protobuf.sln* in current directory.

Compiling and Installing
========================

1. Check whether a gmock directory exists in the upper level directory. If you
   checkout the code from github via "git clone", this gmock directory won't
   exist and you won't be able to build protobuf unit-tests. Consider using one
   of the release tar balls instead:

        https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases

   These release tar balls are more stable versions of protobuf and already
   have the gmock directory included.

   You can also download gmock by yourself and put it in the right place.

   If you absolutely don't want to build and run protobuf unit-tests, skip
   this step and use protobuf at your own risk.

2. Use cmake to generate MSVC project files. Running the following commands
   in a command shell will generate project files for Visual Studio 2008 in
   a sub-directory named "build".

        $ cd path/to/protobuf/cmake
        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" ..

   If you don't have gmock, skip the build of tests by turning off the
   BUILD_TESTING option:

        $ cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF ..

3. Open the generated protobuf.sln file in Microsoft Visual Studio.
4. Choose "Debug" or "Release" configuration as desired.
5. From the Build menu, choose "Build Solution".  Wait for compiling to finish.
6. If you have built tests, run tests.exe and lite-test.exe from a command
   shell and check that all tests pass. Make sure you have changed the working
   directory to the output directory because tests.exe will try to find and run
   test_plugin.exe in the working directory.
7. Run extract_includes.bat to copy all the public headers into a separate
   "include" directory. This batch script can be found along with the generated
   protobuf.sln file in the same directory.
8. Copy the contents of the include directory to wherever you want to put
   headers.
9. Copy protoc.exe wherever you put build tools (probably somewhere in your
   PATH).
10. Copy libprotobuf.lib, libprotobuf-lite.lib, and libprotoc.lib wherever you
    put libraries.

  To avoid conflicts between the MSVC debug and release runtime libraries, when
  compiling a debug build of your application, you may need to link against a
  debug build of libprotobuf.lib.  Similarly, release builds should link against
  release libs.

DLLs vs. static linking
=======================

Static linking is now the default for the Protocol Buffer libraries.  Due to
issues with Win32's use of a separate heap for each DLL, as well as binary
compatibility issues between different versions of MSVC's STL library, it is
recommended that you use static linkage only.  However, it is possible to
build libprotobuf and libprotoc as DLLs if you really want.  To do this,
do the following:

  1. Add an additional flag "-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON" when invoking cmake:

        $ cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..

  2. Follow the same steps as described in the above section.
  3. When compiling your project, make sure to #define PROTOBUF_USE_DLLS.

When distributing your software to end users, we strongly recommend that you
do NOT install libprotobuf.dll or libprotoc.dll to any shared location.
Instead, keep these libraries next to your binaries, in your application's
own install directory.  C++ makes it very difficult to maintain binary
compatibility between releases, so it is likely that future versions of these
libraries will *not* be usable as drop-in replacements.

If your project is itself a DLL intended for use by third-party software, we
recommend that you do NOT expose protocol buffer objects in your library's
public interface, and that you statically link protocol buffers into your
library.

ZLib support
============

If you want to include GzipInputStream and GzipOutputStream
(google/protobuf/io/gzip_stream.h) in libprotobuf, you will need to do a few
additional steps:

1. Obtain a copy of the zlib library.  The pre-compiled DLL at zlib.net works.
2. Make sure zlib's two headers are in your include path and that the .lib file
   is in your library path.  You could place all three files directly into this
   cmake directory to compile libprotobuf, but they need to be visible to
   your own project as well, so you should probably just put them into the
   VC shared icnlude and library directories.
3. Add flag "-DZLIB=ON" when invoking cmake:

        $ cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" -DZLIB=ON ..

   If it reports NOTFOUND for zlib_include or zlib_lib, you might haven't put
   the headers or the .lib file in the right directory.
4) Open the generated protobuf.sln file and build as usual.

Notes on Compiler Warnings
==========================

The following warnings have been disabled while building the protobuf libraries
and compiler.  You may have to disable some of them in your own project as
well, or live with them.

* C4018 - 'expression' : signed/unsigned mismatch
* C4146 - unary minus operator applied to unsigned type, result still unsigned
* C4244 - Conversion from 'type1' to 'type2', possible loss of data.
* C4251 - 'identifier' : class 'type' needs to have dll-interface to be used by
  clients of class 'type2'
* C4267 - Conversion from 'size_t' to 'type', possible loss of data.
* C4305 - 'identifier' : truncation from 'type1' to 'type2'
* C4355 - 'this' : used in base member initializer list
* C4800 - 'type' : forcing value to bool 'true' or 'false' (performance warning)
* C4996 - 'function': was declared deprecated

C4251 is of particular note, if you are compiling the Protocol Buffer library
as a DLL (see previous section).  The protocol buffer library uses templates in
its public interfaces.  MSVC does not provide any reasonable way to export
template classes from a DLL.  However, in practice, it appears that exporting
templates is not necessary anyway.  Since the complete definition of any
template is available in the header files, anyone importing the DLL will just
end up compiling instances of the templates into their own binary.  The
Protocol Buffer implementation does not rely on static template members being
unique, so there should be no problem with this, but MSVC prints warning
nevertheless.  So, we disable it.  Unfortunately, this warning will also be
produced when compiling code which merely uses protocol buffers, meaning you
may have to disable it in your code too.
